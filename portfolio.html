            <h2>Study Abroad Experience</h2>    
          <p>  During the summer of 2013 I went on a study abroad trip to Berlin with the University of Florida. While enjoying all Berlin had to offer, I had to work on a project involving photography and audio. 
For this project I had to find and interview someone in Berlin, take pictures of his or her day to day life and then use programs like Audacity, Adobe Photoshop and Soundslides to edit it all together and create a slideshow.  </p>
            <p>For my project, I interviewed and took pictures of a man named Felix Eichholtz, the owner of a specialty chili shop called the Pferrerhaus. It was my first time using a DSLR camera (the Canon Digital Rebel T3i) as well as the three programs I mentioned above and I'm really happy with how my <a href="http://www.jou.ufl.edu/people/faculty/jfreeman/Berlin2013/JOANNE_publish_to_web/index.html" target="_blank" alt="This is my Study Abroad Project">final project</a> came out.</p>
