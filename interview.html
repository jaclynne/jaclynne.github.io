        <h3>How long have you been cosplaying? </h3>
                <p>I would say about 4 years now. I think I started in about 12th grade or beginning college                here. </p> 

        <h3>What did you first cosplay as? </h3>
            <p>I cosplayed with my best friend when she was still here and we did Youji and Natsuo from                 Loveless. They’re a pair that go around together and fight other pairs. We had little cat ears                          and tails. Classic, I think. </p>

        <h3>Did you have fun? </h3>
            <p>Oh yeah! Definitely. It was our first thing, our first cosplay, and we did it together so we             go over that initial nervousness of “Oh my gosh, I’m all alone what if nobody likes me” because             we weren’t. </p>

        <h3>Did you make it? </h3>
            <p>Yes. I actually had help on my first one because I didn’t know how to sew at that time. so I             got one of my friends mom who had a sewing machine and I walked up to her with a fabric and a           pattern that I’d drawn myself and I said “Hey can you help me?” and so she kind of fixed it up a little bit     and put it together. They were just like little tunics, basically. Like dress tunics with sailor collars and they were pretty simple but way out of my depth at that time. </p>

        <h3>So you made your own pattern? How did you go about doing that? </h3>
            <p>There are patterns at JoAnn’s and other sewing stores but I haven’t figured out how to use               them yet so I make everything from scratch. I basically take my own measurements and then                                                           usually take a piece of cardboard or a big piece of blank paper, brown wrapping paper, whatever, and you kind of draw it on there and sort of just figure it out. I usually just make it big and then I can size it down later in case because you can make it smaller but you can’t make it bigger again so yeah, you just kinda fool around until it works. </p>

        <h3>So what other cosplays have you made? </h3>
            <p>For the last couple of years, I’ve been really heavily into Homestuck and so I’ve made a lot             of cosplays for that.  I probably have six or seven for Homestuck at this point. Yeah, a lot.       I’m working on a cosplay for the Whosical for Swampcon. And also welcome to nightvale cosplay and I can’t remember the name of the show I’m thinking of. Oh, I’ve done a character from GetBackers the anime and I did a Naruto character a really long time ago  just whatever catches my fancy at the time but I’ve been so into Homestuck that I really haven’t done much else in quite a while. </p>

        <h3>Speaking of Homestuck, your profile picture on Facebook is of one of the trolls from Homestuck.         Can you tell me more about that? </h3>
            <p>So that is Demara Megido. She is not one of the main trolls, the beta troiks, but she is is              one of the alpha trolls in a separate time line and they’re all already dead and she’s supposed         to represent Aries, the ram So she has ram horns and she’s kind of- she’s supposed to be- all of the trolls are kind of a joke on some form of internet culture and so she’s a joke on the Japanese anime weeaboos she used to live in the forest with a bunch of other big anime fans and they used to all kind of just watch anime and say Japanese together. So she speaks only in Japanese, poorly translated google Japanese but you have to actually copy her text and put it into translate to get some idea of what she’s saying and she’s just very mean and crass and she doesn’t care because they’re all dead and what does it matter. So she’s really silly and she wears like a red schoolgirl Japanese outfit and she’s so funny. </p>

        <h3>How long did it take you to make that cosplay? </h3>
            <p>That’s honestly my favorite because it took me a ridiculous amount of time to make because I             never made a pleated skirt before and I made it from scratch, I just figured out and it was a       couple days of work at least. Just for the clothes because the first time I made the skirt I did it wrong and I had to start over and it was bad because I was on a time crunch because I was putting it together for a panel for Supercon back in July and it was nerve-wracking honestly. I almost lost my mind that weekend. But it came together. It was good but I’m really proud of it because I’d never made those clothing elements before so it was an experience. </p>

        <h3>So you said you’ve gone to Supercon, have you gone to any other Cons? </h3>
            <p>Oh yeah. This year was my first year going to Supercon and going to Shadowcon. I just came               back from that early October in Orlando and I’ve been to Megacon three or four times now and            I’ve been to Metrocon which is my favorite convention down in Tampa like five or six years in a row now. I started back in high school going there and I love it a lot. I’ve been to AFO and Toshocon and quite a few. I know there’s little cons peppered in between but it’s hard to remember. I’ve been to a couple of horror conventions just kind of jump all over Florida whenever something kind of catches my eye and I have the money for it. </p>

        <h3>So do you cosplay at each of those Cons? </h3>
            <p> If possible, yeah. I didn’t cosplay when I was first going to cons because it’s just, cons              are overwhelming enough before getting into cosplay because cosplay is a dedication. Once you do        it at a con that’s almost all you do at a con unless you’re working in a panel or something. So I usually have an outfit for every day and I kind of walk around it all day. I still have fun and I still go to panels and run around the dealer’s room but yea If I can have an outfit every day, I’m gonna do it. </p>

        <h3>So when you’re in cosplay do you stay in character? </h3>
            <p> I have this way that I pick characters that are not anywhere close to my real personality so            its really hard for me to stay in character like Damara is really mean and I am not, I can’t stop       laughing half the time so I guess if I’m around other people in cosplay and the situation calls for it I’ll jump into character but usually not because you have to talk to people who come up to you and you can’t be- There’s a level of like etiquette you need to follow in Cons so if your character is really loud and annoying  its generally not a good idea to run around screaming. Like in SoulEater,  you’re Black Star run around screaming “I’m Black Star” you just don’t need to do that. </p>

        <h3>Have you ever Cosplayed as Black Star? </h3>
            <p>Oh I wish. I want to cosplay Medusa really bad.

        <h3>That would be a pretty legit costume. </h3>
            <p>Yeah, I’m waiting on that one because that wig is a little cray. </p>

        <h3>What would you recommend for someone who is trying to get into making their own cosplay?                </h3>
            <p>Pick something you really, really like the first time because you’re going to get frustrated             when you put it together. Pick something that’s not  really difficult. Youji wasn’t that hard. He was tunic and making some ears and a tail and a wig and that was altogether pretty easy so you pick something  thatyou really like and you think you can do with streatching your current talents just a little bit further. And each cosplay you do after that you streatch just a little bit further. And you just try and really  have fun with it. If you can find other people who like the same thing you do and want to cosplay with you in a group  I’d definitely recommend that because it makes it so much more exciting and then you have a whole other resource to go to and say “I don’t know how to do this, do you know how to do this?” It’s just  you have to really, really want to do it because it gets tough sometimes. </p>

        <h3>From what I’ve seen there’s a division between people who make their own and people who buy             their cosplays. Have you seen that or experienced it? </h3>
            <p>In the last few years I actually have noticed a decline in people seeming to buy their                   cosplays. There are some cosplays  that I know are bought when I look at them. Some of the elements from Attack on Titan costumes are  definitely bought and in certain situations I think that’s totally fine because making it is honestly too much work.  Making 3D maneuver gear is ridiculous and why would you want to?  So in those cases, I kind of just glance the other way. Like it really looks amazing, I know you put effort into the rest of it and you know, not really a big deal. Everyone buys some element of their cosplay, whether  it’s the wig or the gloves or the shoes. I mean almost always you’re going to buy something. Unless you really want to torture yourself because sometimes its just easier. If you’re buying your whole cosplay and that’s all you’ve done, I would say maybe attempt to branch out and try to make some element.  Because it really shows how much you love that character and how much you love that anime or fandom that you went that extra mile for it. But everyone does what they want to do and if you just want to run around in a Sailor Moon cosplay that you bought off the internet because you love it so much and you just want to have fun, whatever , do that.  But if you want to cosplay and be respected as a cosplayer you’re going to have to start making your own stuff. </p>

        <h3>Is there anything else that you would like to add about cosplay or anime conventions or your            future plans for cosplaying? Anything? </h3>
            <p>If you’ve never been to an anime convention and you kind of want to, just go. They are so                much fun. One coming up is SwampCon, here at the University. January 18th and 19th and if you go    come to the Dr. Who Musical because I going to be there! </p>

        <h3>Are you going to be in the musical? Acting? Who are you going to be? Is it a surprise? </h3>
            <p>I don’t think dropped any of the names yet so I think I’ll probably keep that one under wraps but it’s going to be good. </p>
