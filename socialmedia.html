        <p>What to see what I’m up to and things that I love? Check out my Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube accounts! </p>

        <p>Twitter: This is where I’ll be posting about new fandoms I find, talking about the fandoms I currently enjoy and posting news about my blog. If you’re looking for something new to watch or play, check it out. </p>
        
        <p>Pinterest: The plan is to pin on a board each weekday. “Fangirling like a Boss” is the Monday board where I post about the different types of media I enjoy. It can run the gambit from video games to books. Tuesday is “EAT. Pray. Yum” for my inner foodie. On Wednesdays “Daydreams and Pretty Things” is where I’ll pin beautiful landscapes, real or imaginary. Thursdays I’ll be posting anything fashion or beauty on my “I Spy With My Little Eye Board”. Finally, on Fridays I’ll be pinning on “ERMERGERD WEDDRINS!” with anything concerning weddings. </p>

        <p>YouTube: You can expect anything from a critique of a video game to a nail art tutorial. Anything goes on my YouTube channel and I can’t wait to see what happens. </p>
